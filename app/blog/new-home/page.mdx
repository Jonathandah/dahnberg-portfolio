The last couple of weeks I've had zero energy to code in my spare time. I'm usually like that, I think? Either hyper obsessed with it or just like "nah, not for me".
This time though there's a reasonable reason. Two months ago I decided that I wanted to sell my apartmant that've had for 4 good years in Malm√∂ and buy a new one. I wanted to move to a bigger place that feels big enough that both
me and my deaaar girlfriend can live in. So as the propper and steriotypical programmer that I am, I wanted to know everything about buying and selling apartments. I mean, hey, gotta know 
the most optimal time to sell it, gotta find the most optimal reestater and dont get me started, the most optimal morgate loan. So as you can imagine that takes a lot of energy....probably just me though lol.

But after a 1 month of investingation and 1 month of listing and showings I finnaly sold my apartment, and not only that found a new one as well!! AAAND on top of that manage to time the date I'm handing over my apartment
and getting access to the new one!! You know what they say "life is playing" amma write.

But yeah really excited for the new place and to have more room for my desk!!

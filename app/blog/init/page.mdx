The beginning of my new portfolio: a place where I can dump all my dumb ideas and projects.

So . . . I've finished my new portfolio, at least for now. My intention with it is just to have a place where I can share my thoughts and projects that I'll probably never finish. It's okay, though! Hahaha.

It's taken me quite a while to finish it. To be honest, I started it a year ago. It's hard, man. I've thought a lot about who I am and how I want to be perceived, both as a developer and as a person. I guess in theory it's easy: I'm a nerd who likes minimalistic designs, suddle animations, anime, fancy coffee, and long runs with overpriced running shoes. Easy. Now put that into code and make it look good . . . huh?? What? 

I finally feel like I've managed to create a portfolio that feels like me (without the coffe and overpriced shoes).

That's it for now! Bye.
